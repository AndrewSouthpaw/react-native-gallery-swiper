## Scroll state and events

* `onPageScroll` : (event) => {}. 

    The event object carries following data: 

    * `position`:  index of first page from the left that is currently visible.
    * `offset`: value from range [0,1) describing stage between page transitions.
    * `fraction`: means that (1 - x) fraction of the page at "position" index is visible, and x fraction of the next page is visible.

* `onPageScrollStateChanged` : (state) => {}.

    Called when the page scrolling state has changed. The page scrolling state can be in 3 states:

    * `'idle'`: there is no interaction with the page scroller happening at the time.
    * `'dragging'`: there is currently an interaction with the page scroller.
    * `'settling'`: there was an interaction with the page scroller, and the page scroller is now finishing its closing or opening animation.
